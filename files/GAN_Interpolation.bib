	abstract = {A main challenge in seismic imaging is acquiring densely sampled data. Compressed Sensing has provided theoretical foundations upon which desired sampling rate can be achieved by applying a sparsity promoting algorithm on sub-sampled data. The key point in successful recovery is to deploy a randomized sampling scheme. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based method for fast and accurate reconstruction of heavily under-sampled seismic data, regardless of type of sampling. A neural network learns to do reconstruction directly from data via an adversarial process. Once trained, the reconstruction can be done by just feeding the frequency slice with missing data into the neural network. This adaptive nonlinear model makes the algorithm extremely flexible, applicable to data with arbitrarily type of sampling. With the assumption that we have access to training data, the quality of reconstructed slice is superior even for extremely low sampling rate (as low as 10\%) due to the data-driven nature of the method.},
