    abstract = {We propose a {\textquoteleft}learned{\textquoteright} iterative solver for the Helmholtz equation, by combining traditional Krylov-based solvers with machine learning. The method is, in principle, able to circumvent the shortcomings of classical iterative solvers, and has clear advantages over purely data-driven ap- proaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach under a 1.5-D assumption, when ade- quate a priori information about the velocity distribution is known.},
